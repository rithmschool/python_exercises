# Many to Many

### Part 1 

1. Create a many to many application with employees and departments.

Your app should have the following features:

* Full CRUD on employees
	* The index page for employees should show the department name
* Able to see index page and show page for department (no need to have create, delete, or edit for departments)
	* The departments show page should show all employees in the department
* Use WTF for all of your forms in employees

### Part 2 - BONUS

Add another resource to your application! You can either implement a followers/following functionality, and/or a likes/favorites functionality for messages.
