# Flask CRUD

For this application you will be building CRUD on the resouce `snacks`. Your application should:

- display all the `snacks`
- allow a user to create `snacks` 
    -  each snack should have a `name` and `kind`
- allow a user to edit a snack
- allow a user to delete a snack

You should use a list to store your snacks and make a class for a snack to create instances from.
